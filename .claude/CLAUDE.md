## Code Style Guidelines

- Skip comments unless explicitly requested or critical for understanding complex logic
- Prefer ripgrep (rg) for all text searches
- Re-read existing files completely before making any edits to understand context and conventions

## Testing Philosophy

- Write tests that verify user-facing behavior and outcomes, not internal implementation
- Test from the perspective of how users interact with the code
- Validate all modifications against the actual implementation before finalizing
